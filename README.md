## Setting Up for Mail Subscription Service

Here is the detailed step about how to configure the backend mail server for GitHub Pages (or other web services that only support frontend pages).

1. Generate HTML Mail Template (Postcards)
    
    [Postcards - Designmodo](https://designmodo.com/postcards/app/)
    
    After editing the contents, export as a ZIP file with the images and HTML files together.
    
2. Domain Email Account Registration and SMTP Server Setting
    
    [GoDaddy Webmail](https://email.godaddy.com/)
    
3. Use EmailJS for Email Backend Service
    
    Basic Setting
    
    [Send email directly from your code | EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
    
    REST API Documentation
    
    [/send API | EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/rest-api/send/)
    
    Note: 
    
    - SMTP.js only supports elasticemail as its backend SMTP mail server, no third-party SMTP server is supported.
    - The limitation of the content body of EmailJS is no more than 50kb, be sure the size of the HTML file is less than the threshold.
    - We can use the following website to shrink the size of the HTML file by removing the unnecessary characters (like white space, etc)
        
        [HTML Compressor - Reduce the size of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Smarty code.](https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/)
        
4. Backblaze B2 OBS Bucket for Image Storage
    
    We need to upload the images extracted from the downloaded ZIP file to the OBS bucket and replace all of the image paths from the relative path to the HTTPS path, which can be obtained through the detailed property of the file in the OBS bucket.

## Setting Up `contract-config.json` for Local Deployment

To successfully deploy and run the project locally, you need to create a `contract-config.json` file in the root directory of the project. This file contains essential configuration details needed for the application to interact with the blockchain network.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the File:**
   - In the root directory of your project, create a file named `contract-config.json`.

2. **Add Basic Structure:**
   - Open the file in a text editor and add the following JSON structure:
     ```json
     {
         "_comment": "Configuration settings for blockchain interaction and Turnstile widget. 'projectId' is the unique identifier for the project, 'activeNetwork' specifies the blockchain network (like 'baseMainnet' for Base Mainnet or 'baseSepolia' for Sepolia Base Testnet or 'sepolia' for Sepolia Main Testnet), 'contractAddress' is the address of the smart contract, 'authWebAddress' is the API endpoint for backend authentication server, and 'turnstileSiteKey' is the site key for the Cloudflare Turnstile widget.",
         "activeNetwork": "Your_Network_Choice",
         "contractAddress": "Your_Contract_Address",
         "authWebAddress": "Your_Web_Address",
         "turnstileSiteKey": "Your_CloudFlare_Turnstile_Site_Key",
         "emailToken": "Your_Email_Token",
         "emailServiceID": "Your_Email_Service_ID",
         "emailTemplate": "Your_Email_Template",
         "tweetId": "Your_Tweet_Id",
         "tweetMessage": "Your_Tweet_Message",
         "userName": "Your_User_Name",
         "checkRetweetEnabled": "true",
         "checkTweetEnabled": "true",
         "checkLikeEnabled": "true",
         "checkFollowEnabled": "true",
         "retweetEnabled": "true",
         "tweetEnabled": "true",
         "likeEnabled": "true",
         "followEnabled": "true"
     }
     ```
   - Replace `Your_Network_Choice` with the network you are using (e.g., `base` for the Base Mainnet).
   - Replace `Your_Contract_Address` with the actual contract address you are using.
   - Replace `Your_Web_Address` with the web address for airdrop eligibility check.
   - Replace `Your_CloudFlare_Turnstile_Site_Key` with the site key for the Cloudflare Turnstile widget.
   - Replace `Your_Email_Token` with the token for sending emails.
   - Replace `Your_Email_Service_ID` with the service ID for sending emails, for example: `lotso_email`.
   - Replace `Your_Email_Template` with the email template name, for example: `lotso_email_template`.
   - Replace `Your_Tweet_Id` with the tweet ID for the target tweet.
   - Replace `Your_Second_Tweet_Id` with the second tweet ID for the target tweet.
   - Replace `Your_User_Name` with the user ID for the target user.

3. **Save the File:**
   - Save your changes to `contract-config.json`.

4. **Important Notes:**
   - The `contract-config.json` file is crucial for the application's interaction with the blockchain. Ensure that the details are correct.
   - If you are working in a team or planning to push this code to a public repository, **do not** include sensitive information like private keys or secret tokens in the `contract-config.json` file. Instead, use environment variables or other secure methods to handle sensitive data.

5. **.gitignore:**
   - If you are using Git, make sure to add `contract-config.json` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally pushing it to a public repository:
     ```bash
     echo "contract-config.json" >> .gitignore
     ```

### Example File

Here is an example of what your `contract-config.json` might look like for the Base Mainnet:

```json
{
    "_comment": "Configuration settings for blockchain interaction and Turnstile widget. 'projectId' is the unique identifier for the project, 'activeNetwork' specifies the blockchain network (like 'baseMainnet' for Base Mainnet or 'baseSepolia' for Sepolia Base Testnet or 'sepolia' for Sepolia Main Testnet), 'contractAddress' is the address of the smart contract, 'authWebAddress' is the API endpoint for backend authentication server, and 'turnstileSiteKey' is the site key for the Cloudflare Turnstile widget.",
    "projectId": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "activeNetwork": "baseMainnet",
    "contractAddress": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "authWebAddress": "https://api.btiplatform.com",
    "turnstileSiteKey": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "emailToken": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "emailServiceID": "lotso_email",
    "emailTemplate": "lotso_email_template",
    "tweetId": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "tweetMessage": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",
    "userName": "0x123abc456def789ghi",
    "checkRetweetEnabled": "false",
    "checkTweetEnabled": "false",
    "checkLikeEnabled": "true",
    "checkFollowEnabled": "true",
    "retweetEnabled": "true",
    "tweetEnabled": "true",
    "likeEnabled": "true",
    "followEnabled": "true"
}
```

Once you have created and configured your `contract-config.json` file, you can proceed with the local deployment of the application.
